# WeatherPy
What's the Weather like

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

The objective was to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
